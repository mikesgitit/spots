## Project 3: Spots

GIT - https://mikesgitit.github.io/spots

For this project I implemented a variety of new technologies and processes that enhance user experience and responsive design. Some of the techniques employed in the project include: flexbox, grid, media queries, custom properties, buttons, hover and focus effects, and text-overflow. This project challenged me to take the skills we have been learning and use them in a creative way to satisfy the project requirements. Some of the skills feel more natural and ingrained, whereas other strategies are still a bit foreign for me. Nevertheless, I feel as though I have created a layout that is responsive to different viewports and will be easy to maintain going forward.

'Spots' functions as a webpage for users to upload photos and interact with other users. The template I created has been designed for maximum accessibility across different devices. I acheived this by using a grid layout with media queries that adjust the size of photos or images depending on the device viewport. The images remain static in their aspect ratio of 1 regardless of the screen dimensions. Additionally, I employed the use of custom properties which, sets a value that is commonly used throughout the code to be recalled easily. This in turn creates consistency and makes implementing themes or variations easier. The hover and focus effects were designed to make user engagement more meaningful. Hover effects were used as per the project requirements, but I added some focus effects on the 'like' button to really pop. The heart image scales 1.25x the original, emphasizing the user interaction. BEM was also used
