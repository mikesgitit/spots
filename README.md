Project 3: Spots

For this project I implemented a variety of technologies and processes that enhance user experience and responsive design. Some of the technologies or techniques employed in the project include: flexbox, grid, media queries, root, buttons, hover effects, and text-overflow. This project challenged me to take the skills we have been learning and use them in a creative way to satisfy the project requirements. Some of the skills feel more natural and engrained, whereas other strategies are still a bit foreign for me. Nevertheless, I feel as though I have created a layout that is responsive and to different viewports and will be adaptive to end users.

Spots functions as a webpage for users to upload photos and interact with other users. The template I created has been designed for maximum accessibility across different devices. I acheived this by using a grid layout with media queries that adjust the size of photos or images depending on the device viewport. The images remain static in their aspect ratio of 1 regardless of the screen dimensions. I

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
